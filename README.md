# naive-columstore

This is a simple, toy column store implemented as a result of reading 'The Design and Implementation of Modern Column-Oriented Database Systems'[1]. To keep everything sane and typesafe, this is a bespoke implementation for a dataset collected from mtgprice.

I'm starting to benchmark early and releases will be tagged for when benchmarks can be stably compared.
